## Note of Gratitude to Someone on Campus

I am very grateful to my Ap Calculus AB teacher, Mrs. Nydam. I struggled a lot in her class because all of the content was new to me and it was difficult to understand. Gradually, with the help from Mrs. Nydam, I was able to understand the content and do well in the class.

## Note of Gratitude to Someone at Home

I am very grateful for my mom who works hard to support me. Whenever I need help on homework, studying, or other things, she's always there to help me so I'm very grateful for her help.

What I'm grateful for:

1. My supportive teachers at Del Norte
2. My Parents and the work they have done to support me
3. My friends at school
4. Air conditioning; Especially during these hot summer days
